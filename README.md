Why do we need to perform memory testing?

Unreliable RAM, or random-access memory, can lead to a variety of problems with your computer, including corrupted data, crashes, and strange, unexplained behaviour. Having flawed or damaged RAM can be one of the most frustrating computer problems because symptoms are very often random and difficult to identify. MemTest86+ is a useful tool that can be downloaded onto a CD/DVD or a USB and help diagnose faulty RAM. It is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, and PC manufacturers.
